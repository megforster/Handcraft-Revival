                <p class="secondaryFont">Yarn Weight, used to describe the thickness of a yarn skein, is an important topic to understand. Many patters you will encounter give a reccomended yarn wight (and hook size)
                    for good reason. Yarns typically come in 7 thicknesses that range from the thickness of a thread to almost the thickness of a finger; the amount needed and hook used can vary greatly.
                    Some yarn weights are also easier to work with than others when it comes to beginners: a heavier (thicker) weight tends to be reccomended. It is also good to keep in mind that some
                    wieghts have alternate names (e.g. weight three is also called light).

                <p class="secondaryFont">
                    The most common, and easiest way, to determine yarn weight is to look at the yarn's label. Pretty much ever yarn skein's label contains a symbol or description of the skein's wight. 
                    A yarn weight symbol is conprised of a skien of yarn with a number overlaid on top of it. See the below image.

                <p class="secondaryFont">
                    Each yarn weight also comes with a reccomended hook size (the symbol as a whole refered to as gague). For knitters, there is a similar gague section for knitting needles. For example, it wouldn't make much sense to use a teeny-tiny hook on jumbo yarn. This symbol is typically located near or 
                    next to the yarn weight indicator. The symbol itself consists of a picture of a crochet hook, the hook size in milimeters and US size, and numbers along the left and top side that indicate the size of the gague square. The numbers along the right and bottom of the square indicate how many 
                    rows and stitches the gague sqaure comprises of. Gague squares are used to help crafters understand how large/small/tight/loose their sitiches should be for a pattern.See below for an example.

                <p class="secondaryFont">
                    Let's break down this example. Firstly, it is reccomended to use a 6mm hook, also known as a US J-10. The gague sqaure should be 10cm by 10cm or 4in by 4in. To acheive this size, there should be 12 rows of 11 single crochets (sc is the abbreviation for single crochet).

                <h4 class="centered mainFont primaryColorLight">Telling Yarn Weight Without A Label</h4>
                <p class="secondaryFont">
                    Now having a label to tell you a yarn's weight is all well and good, but what happens if the label is missing? Most crocheters (and knitters) then use a method called Wraps Per Inch. This method requires a ruler, the mystery yarn, and (optionally) an object with a consistent circumfrence.
                    To calculate the weight, simply wrap the yarn around an inch of your obejct (or ruler) counting the number of wraps. It is better to wrap a little tighter since you do not want to leave gaps or loose pockets. Once you have the number of wraps, simply match it to the standard number of 
                    wraps for a yarn weight. Below is a chart from the Craft Yarn Council (CYC).
