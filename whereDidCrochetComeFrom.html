                <p class="secondaryFont">
                    While the birth place of crochet remains unclear, having only evolved to a form we recognize today in the 1800s as it gained popularity in Europe, it is still fascinating
                    to see how cultures around the world explored similar practices. By piecing together even a rough timeline we can get a glimpse into the past and understand how such a
                    treasured pasttime survived the ages. It is also interesting to see the transition of crochet from being a mainly practical craft to an almost entirely leisure-based one.

                <p class="secondaryFont">
                    This theory suggests that crochet began in Saudai Arabia before spreading eastward to Tibet and westward to Spain and then other Mediterranean countries via trade routes.
                    Pamir culture provides some evidence for this theory as their traditional Pamir hooks, thick and colorful socks, and overall culture are closly tied with tied with ancient 
                    Persia (a place it is theorized Arabian crochet reached due to similar evidence in the Mediterranean). Otherwise, there is little more evidence that has been popularized.

                <p class="secondaryFont">
                   Some of the earliest examples of crochet in South America come from adornments supposedly used in rghts of puberty. 
                   Primitve tribes where said to crochet these adornments using simple stitches. Sadly, there is not much else surviving
                   information.

                <p class="secondaryFont">
                    The most common theory is that crochet spawned out of the ancient Chinese practice of tambour. Tambouring did not reach Europe intil the 1700s, and even then did not take on the name crochet
                    until the end of the 18th century. Tambouring consisted of stretching a background fabric tightly over a frame. A thread is held underneath the fabric and a hooked needle is pushed through the
                    fabric, hooked on a loop of thread, and pulled back through the fabric. Chain stitches where accomplished by working the hooked needle, with the thread loop still around it, back through the
                    fabric father down with the new thread loop pulled through the old. It is believed the thread was very fine as surviving hooks are a similar size to sewing needles. Early examples include 3D 
                    dolls that seem to me made of crocheted stitches
